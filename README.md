I am Soha Khan, a first-year computer science student at FAST NUCES. I have a strong foundation in C++ from my high school studies, and I'm now diving deeper into C as part of my university coursework. I'm excited to expand my knowledge and apply these skills to build practical projects. I'm always open to connecting with other students and developers!
